# Product Roadmap: Baseline

## Vision

Transform the Chronic Pain Diary into **Baseline** — a flexible, user-centric tracking platform that empowers users to monitor any aspect of their life—pain, mood, menstrual cycles, habits, or entirely custom metrics—with beautiful visualizations and actionable insights.

**Why "Baseline"?** Know your baseline, spot the changes. It captures the essence of tracking: understanding your normal so you can identify what's different.

## Phase 6: AI-Powered Health Reports (v5.0) ❌ NOT STARTED

### Goal

Generate professional, readable health reports for sharing with healthcare providers—powered by Gemini AI.

### Concept

Building on Phase 7's PDF export, this adds AI-generated narrative insights:
- Summarize patterns and trends in natural language
- Highlight anomalies and correlations across trackers
- Format as a searchable, printable document (not raw data)
- Alternative to CSV for doctor visits: "Here's what my last 3 months looked like"

### Why This Matters

Doctors don't have time to parse spreadsheets. A well-formatted report with AI-generated insights makes tracked health data actionable in clinical settings.
