I didn\u2019t think about it at the time but he kept watching a certain film and singing big boys don\u2019t cry. I think he was trying to tell me something or anyone who would listen. I was always the one who understood the dynamics of family conflicts as a child, so he said. I was thoughtful at the time but I was eventually broken by the chaos and I had my own crisis, one after the other which led me into depression and unorganised thoughts, an inner chaos that I couldn\u2019t reason my way out of. I think that my patterns of thought, overthinking and intellect came from him. It\u2019s his resolve that I can\u2019t help admiring along with fearing his wilful path to an end. The thing is, because I know where my patterns of thinking are from, I know that as well as the resolve to continue into oblivion lies a deeply buried need to be loved and accepted. And I want to give him that but every time I have in the past he has responded with the only way he knows, dominant behaviour. And I can\u2019t let go.

It's the only hope I ever have but after the session I feel like I'm getting nowhere and my therapist can't direct me or give an opinion because ethics but even if I'm not always receptive I'd welcome her telling me what I need to do apart from the usual, be good to yourself, self-love, self-care etc. Those things make me cringe because I hate myself. I really wish I didn't live in a world where I have to love myself before I can love anyone else. I understand but all I have and all I am can love and care for my loved ones.

But I do now because I imagined our roles reversed. She didn\u2019t say it because she is bound by her professional language. It wasn\u2019t hard to read between her words. She got freaked out because she doesn\u2019t understand how easy it is to clone any website on the public internet. Without knowing technology it would be unnerving. Obviously I can\u2019t be completely certain she got freaked out and thought I saw our therapy sessions as more than counselling, but it\u2019s the best guess based on her email informing me I\u2019m no longer her client. I replied and made sure she has basic knowledge about how anyone can do exactly what I did, that I\u2019d obviously take down the private link to the improved version of her website and there is nothing more to it. I apologised. What hit me hard has nothing to do with who she is particularly, because I don\u2019t depend, pretend she\u2019s my friend and nor have I ever even thought about counselling as anything more than an important part of my support network. I acted from the same place as the other websites I found and redesigned, to feel useful. Now I realise most people probably think alike. So I got rid of the other websites I redesigned because I imagined myself either emailing or calling them and saying hi I made your website better because it\u2019s a hobby and I want to feel useful instead of suicidal.

Not always, the right set of circumstances have to be in play. I ordered pizza and it came fast. The voices have calmed with me. It feels like being in stasis. The screen is set on dark mode. I'm not sure what else other than I took my evening anxiety meds which don't always work because tolerance builds over time and the only way I'd notice a difference is by forgetting to take them. It's happened before. Two days I missed and I was in a state of constant panic. Then I remembered a rifled through my meds and took the dose plus what I'd missed. I was desperate. Desperation is a daily feature for me. Fighting with people I can only just see from the corners of my eyes. Being alone and too afraid to go out. Even ordering food is stressful. Having to say that I can't come to the building door because poor mobility. It doesn't even matter to them but if I don't write it in the delivery instructions I can't guarantee I'll be able to answer the door in time. As it is I have to wait by the buzzer on a seat in case I can't get to the buzzer quickly enough. I've fallen over regularly. Every time I have to get up I use the sofa, walls. I mostly start falling backwards. It's all about making a plan because I need my dignity like anyone else. I started writing this because feeling a bit like I can relax doesn't happen often and it only ever happens in the evening. The pizza has helped my constant hunger pangs, settled the part of my system that's always anxious because I can't even face microwaving a simple ready meal because it's painful, I have no motivation and  don't want to be awake.
